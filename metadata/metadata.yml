description: |-
  The rise of populism concerns many political scientists and practitioners, yet, the detection of its underlying language remains fragmentary.
  This paper aims to provide a reliable, valid, and scalable approach to measure populist rhetoric.
  For that purpose, we created an annotated dataset based on parliamentary speeches of the German Bundestag (2013--2021).
  Following the ideational definition of populism, we label moralizing references to ``the virtuous people'' or ``the corrupt elite'' as core dimensions of populist language.
  To identify, in addition, how the thin ideology of populism is ``thickened'', we annotate how populist statements are attached to left-wing or right-wing host ideologies.
  We then train a transformer-based model (PopBERT) as a multilabel classifier to detect and quantify each dimension.
  A battery of validation checks reveals that the model has a strong predictive accuracy, provides high qualitative face validity, matches party rankings of expert surveys, and detects out-of-sample text snippets correctly.
  PopBERT enables dynamic analyses of how German-speaking politicians and parties use populist language as a strategic device.
  Furthermore, the annotator-level data may also be applied in cross-domain applications or to develop related classifiers.
